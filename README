This project is just a demo regarding the plotting of data.
Matlab exports in json as well as other json data can be used to generate basic plots.

Dependencies:
- matplotlib
- pandas

The format of the given json file should be:
{
...
...
"measurements" [
        {
          "value1": "data1",
          ...,
          ...,
          "value8": "data8",
        },
    ]
}

Furthermore the json file should be placed in the data directory and the path should look like "data/%name_of_your_file%"
Currently one measurement entry can contain up to eight different value : data pairs.
In most use cases the value1 would be the x-axis value (often the time value).
